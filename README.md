# Pandas Challenge

## Analysis and Conclusions
There are 15 schools in the district with 39,170 students, the passing percentage for both math and reading is 65%. The total budget for the district is $24.65M.

As a whole, higher budgets schools did not yield better test results. The average math score was 66.16% in schools with higher spending ($645-$675 per student), which is 27.3% lower than schools with smaller budgets ($585 per student) that had an average math score of 93.46%.

Charter schools out-performed public schools across all metrics. The largest difference was in overall passing percentage for math and reading. The overall passing percentage for charter schools was 90.43% and for public schools it was 53.67% which is a difference of 36.76%.

Overall, smaller and medium sized schools out-performed large sized schools in overall math and reading performance by passing rates of 89.88% & 90.62% compared to 58.29%.

## District Summary
### I created a Data Frame that highlighted:
Total number of unique schools, Total students, Total budget, Average math score, Average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## School Summary
### I created a Data Frame that highlighted:
School name, School type, Total students, Total school budget, Per student budget, Average math score, Average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
### I created a Data Frame that displayed the top 5 performing schools
